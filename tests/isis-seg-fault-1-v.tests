# This "verbose" ISIS protocol test involves a float calculation that
# may produce a slightly different result depending on the compiler and
# the version of the instruction set for which it's generating code (see
# GitHub issue #333 for another example). The test is done only if we have
# a floating-point type, as reported by "./tcpdump --fp-type", of FPTYPE1.
#
# XXX - this works on my 32-bit x86 Linux virtual machine, so do this
# regardless of the floating-point type, so always do this.  If it
# fails on some platform, we'll need to tweak tcpdump and tests/TESTrun
# to check for *that* floating-point difference.
