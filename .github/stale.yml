  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  activity in the past 60 days.
  Code contributions should include test pcap files, and may need to be rebased regularly.
  Discussion of non-trivial contributes on the tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org mailing list
  is encouraged.
  This issue will be closed if no further activity occurs.
  Thank you for your contributions.
